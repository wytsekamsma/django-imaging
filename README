django-imaging
==============

Proof of concept, based on django-stdimage (http://code.google.com/p/django-stdimage/) and django-thumbs (http://code.google.com/p/django-thumbs/).
Can resize and delete uploaded images.

Usage:
Replace your current ImageField with ExtendedImageField.
Add the 'sizes'-attribute with the sizes you want:
(name (optional) [string], height[int], width[int], crop[boolean, default=True])
The name attribute is appended to the filename of the image you have uploaded (for example: file_i_uploaded_large.jpg). When no name is supplied the size is used: file_i_uploaded_1200.jpg or file_i_uploaded_100x100.jpg
When either height or width is zero, it is calculated to match the requested width or height resp. The crop attribute is disabled in this mode (crop=False).
When crop is set to False, the image will be scaled to fit in the requested frame.

All attributes can be requested via image.size_[name].url/path/size or image.size_[width]x[height].url/path/size

Example:
image = ExtendedImageField(upload_to="img", sizes=(
							("large", 1200, 600),
							("medium", 1200, 0),
							("thumb", 100,100)
							("flickr", 500, 500, False)
						)

Todo:
- better documentation ;)
- preferably some tests
